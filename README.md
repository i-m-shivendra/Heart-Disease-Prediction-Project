## 🚀 Project Highlights  

- **Developed a Heart Disease Prediction model** using **Logistic Regression**, achieving high accuracy in classifying individuals as heart disease-positive or negative.  
- 📊 **Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering** on the **Heart Disease Dataset**, handling missing values and ensuring data quality for optimal predictions.  
- ⚡ **Trained and evaluated the model** using **accuracy scores**, ensuring minimal overfitting and reliable performance on both **training (X_train) and test (X_test) datasets**.  
- 🔍 **Built a predictive system** that allows **real-time heart disease prediction** by taking patient health parameters as input and providing an **instant diagnosis**.  
- 💡 **Implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline** using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn**, making the model **scalable and ready for deployment** in healthcare applications.
